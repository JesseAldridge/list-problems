    "why_hard": "Jobs are stressful and demanding. But worse than that your income doesn't scale the way it does if you start a business. Being forced to trade my time for money leaves me feeling stuck, like I'm not getting anywhere in life.",
    "what_done": "I've tried to start several companies over the years, but none of them gained any traction. These companies were generally centered around tools I built for myself. I suspect the root of the problem is that I'm a lot different from most people and therefore only a tiny fraction of the world wants the things I want.",
    "no_love": "I've found it difficult to find good problems to work on. Perhaps because I've done nothing but software my whole life, I don't have a lot of knowledge about domains where I could apply my engineering skills to create a lot of value."
